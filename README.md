### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Emine Kesici and I am a Data Scientist and Quantitative Researcher with background in applied mathematics. I previously worked as a teaching/research assistant at a higher education institution, published two math research articles at decent journals, and presented several articles/projects to both technical and nontechnical audiences. I have strong interest in building narratives around data and learning new skills.
